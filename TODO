THOUGHTS
- check if a session exists at start of search
- if session exists and it is very recent (<24h) --> return same if inputs are same
- if session exists and it is old --> run new search and update session
- if session does not exist, create one valid for eternity
- store in session: search params, time of search, search results, choice (i.e., full trace)
- store each trace in database with a unique session identifier
